# Localization

Green Core has built in localization for English (default) and Swedish. The current langugae can be set by calling the `setLocale` function from Green Core:

```js
import { setLocale } from '@sebgroup/green-core'
setLocale('se')
```

This can be called at any time, and it should cause all Green Core components on the page to re-render with the correct locale.

## Additional locales
